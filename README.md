This was a term project for CSI5110 - Principles of Formal Software Development, a graduate-level course at the University of Ottawa.  
Course website: http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~afelty/csi5110/  

This project formalizes mathematical definitions and theorems about inverse semigroups in the Coq proof assistant.  
To install the Coq proof assistant and see it "in action", head to: https://coq.inria.fr/  
For a more human-readable account of the mathematics and a high-level discussion of the motivation behind doing proofs in Coq, see the included .pdf paper.
